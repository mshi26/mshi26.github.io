<h1> About Me</h1>
<h5> I'm a product designer with an interdisciplinary background in graphic design, digital marketing, and finance based in New York City. 

I love creating products that are both useful and visually appealing. I've honed my skills through participation in over 8 hackathons and experience working in fast-paced startup environments. 

I aspire to work with empathy-driven teams to create meaningful products that make a difference in people's lives.

    In my free time, I like to explore the city, try out new food recipes and participate in hackathons!</h5>
